# Particle Collision and Shape Generation in Processing

This Processing project simulates particle movement within a bounded environment and explores the interesting shapes that are created when balls collide with 45-degree angle walls.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements:**
   - Make sure you have Processing installed on your system. You can download it from [Processing's official website](https://processing.org/download).

2. **Open the Project:**
- Launch Processing.
- Click on "File" -> "Open..." and navigate to the cloned project folder.
- Select the "main.pde" Processing file

- Run the Processing sketch by clicking the "Run" button in the Processing IDE or pressing `Ctrl+R` (or `Cmd+R` on Mac).

- Observe the particle movement within the bounded environment.

- Pay attention to the behavior of particles when they hit 45-degree angle walls. This project is designed to create interesting shapes as a result of these collisions.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior and appearance of the particles and walls by modifying the variables and settings in the sketch. Some key configuration options include:

- **Number of particles:** You can adjust the number of particles created

- **Particle properties:** You can modify particle size, color, and velocity in the `Particle` class.

- **Wall properties:** You can change the position, length, and angle of the 45-degree angle walls in the `Wall` class.
